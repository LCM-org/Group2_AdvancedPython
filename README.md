# Group2_AdvancedPython
This repository is for all the work we performed as a group in Advanced Python course for Lambton Mississauga

Project1 for Advanced Python:


This Project depicts our work on linear Regression with Car Data. We took the dataset and performed the cleansing techniques on it and post this plotted multiple graphs (Bar , Heatmaps) to depict the relations between various factors Vs. Car selling Price. in third step we performed Linear regression ignoring Car Name and selling price(y fig.) . In the last step we did sentimental analysis on car models vs. the reviews by customer on that model. In this we failed at a step where plotting against 3args vs a blank field is there. I tried solving it by using python attributes of Nan and other but still a scope to see at the data.
